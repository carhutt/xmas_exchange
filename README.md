Siblings (plus Spouses) Christmas Gift Exchange Program

This is a single Python file that generates a list of pairs of names for a Christmas gift exchange. It has a customizable input array to control who all is participating in the exchange, and is set up to guarantee that in a given year no one is giving a gift to the same person to whom they gave a gift last year.
